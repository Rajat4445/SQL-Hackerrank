Solution: (MySQl)

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE student_salary_friend
SELECT students.ID AS ID, students.name AS name, packages.salary AS salary, friends.friend_ID AS friend_ID
FROM students
LEFT JOIN packages
ON students.id = packages.id
LEFT JOIN friends
ON packages.id = friends.id;

SELECT student_salary_friend.name
FROM student_salary_friend
LEFT JOIN packages
ON student_salary_friend.friend_ID = packages.id

WHERE student_salary_friend.salary < packages.salary
ORDER BY packages.salary ASC
